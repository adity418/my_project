# Rest Blogging application
This application is written with Django rest framework and uses MYSQL DB.
In this project I have implemented the following functionalities:
* Sign up API to create a user.
* Implemented login API for a user.
* Implemented an API to list all the users. This is a pagenated query.
* Created an API to create a BLOG.

Here I have learnt about authentication and authorization as well.

To run this application please run `python manage.py runserver`

Cheers! ðŸš€
